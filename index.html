    <h2>Cleveland Browns</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Browns.jfif" alt="Browns">
    <p> The Cleveland Browns are a football team and have been my favorite team for along time they are now just getting good after 2017 when they were one of the 2 teams ever to go 0-16. They now have a shot at the playoffs</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Columbus Blue Jackets</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Bluejackets.png" alt="Blue Jackets">
    <p> The Columbus Blue Jackets are a hockey team. They are my favorite because they are located in Ohio and that is where most the teams I like are from because I like the state. They are in the playoffs right now against the best team in the league and they have a chance because they are good.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Charlotte Hornets</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Hornets.png" alt="Hornets">
    <p> The Charlotte Hornets are a basketball team. They are my favorite team because of Kemba Walker a top 15 player in the League. I started liking Kemba because of his miracle run in the NCAA tournament when they were seeded 9th in the big east and won 5 straight to win the big east. Then in the tournament they won 6 straight to become national champs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Cleveland Indians</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Indians.jfif" alt="Indians">
